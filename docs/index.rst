   The documentation is currently under construction, and will be iteratively filled throughout the 0.4.x release cycle.
   Until then, expect many stub pages, as well as missing/incorrect content.

This documentation provides a description of heedy's features, as well as examples of their usage. Much of it is focused on programmers
and plugin-writers, to help them extend heedy.
